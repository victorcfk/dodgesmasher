1. 	This project is supposed to be on bitbucket

2. 	Make any util changes here and submit it to bitbucket. You should be pulling from a remote on the web rather than local to get the most up to date changes.

3. 	Eventually you should have a unity project here to edit this helper project with, but you can just use them, modify and copy from any project that uses this util

4. 	In the project that uses this, add the remote to the bitbucket project. 
	Last known address is "git@bitbucket.org:vchua/unityhelpfulutilities.git"(13/12/2017 Singapore Time)
	
5. 	In git bash type the command:
	"git subtree add --prefix=[relative_path] [remote_name] [branch_name]"
	
	Assuming that: 
	remote_name 		= "HelpfulUtilities_DoNotPush"
	remote_branch_name 	= "master"
	local_relative_path = "Assets/HelpfulUtilities/"
	
	[For adding]	git subtree add --prefix=Assets/HelpfulUtilities HelpfulUtilities_DoNotPush master --squash
	[For merging]	git subtree pull --prefix=Assets/HelpfulUtilities HelpfulUtilities_DoNotPush master --squash
	
	? git subtree push --prefix=Assets/HelpfulUtilities HelpfulUtilities_DoNotPush master --squash
	 
6. You should see the history of the unityhelpfulutilities in the project. --squash can be used to remove that history
